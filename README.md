# Expenses

### General info

This is my first step in React. I'm starting with absolute basics to get my hands dirty :)
In this simple app you can add your expense with title, amount and date.
After that you can filter expenses by year. There are also charts that show how much have you spend in specific year. After clicking on any bar you can see expenses is each month in selected year.
